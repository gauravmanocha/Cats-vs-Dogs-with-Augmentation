# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
CNNs are deep learning models suited for analyzing visual imagery. They are heavily influenced by how we - humans, see the surrounding world.For a computer, an image is just an array of values. Typically itâ€™s a 3-dimensional (RGB) matrix of pixel values.
CNN processes images using matrixes of weights called filters (features) that detect specific attributes such as vertical edges, horizontal edges, etc. Moreover, as the image progresses through each layer, the filters are able to recognize more complex attributes. Ultimate goal of the CNN is to detect what is going on in the scene.


# Image Classification - Is it a cat or a dog?
The ultimate goal of this project is to create a system that can detect cats and dogs. While our goal is very specific (cats vs dogs), ImageClassifier can detect anything that is tangible with an adequate dataset.
